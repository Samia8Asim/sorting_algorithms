# Sorting Algorithms

## Introduction

This repository contains the implementation of various sorting algorithms as part of the ALX Software Engineering program. The project aims to explore different sorting techniques, analyze their performance, and understand their applications in different scenarios.

## Repository Contents

Here are the key files and directories in this project:

- **0-bubble_sort.c**: Implementation of the Bubble Sort algorithm.
- **1-insertion_sort_list.c**: Implementation of the Insertion Sort algorithm for linked lists.
- **2-selection_sort.c**: Implementation of the Selection Sort algorithm.
- **3-quick_sort.c**: Implementation of the Quick Sort algorithm.
- **100-shell_sort.c**: Implementation of the Shell Sort algorithm.
- **101-cocktail_sort_list.c**: Implementation of the Cocktail Shaker Sort algorithm for linked lists.
- **102-counting_sort.c**: Implementation of the Counting Sort algorithm.
- **print_array.c**: Helper function to print arrays.
- **print_list.c**: Helper function to print linked lists.
- **sort.h**: Header file containing function prototypes and data structures.

### Additional Files

- **0-main.c, 1-main.c, 2-main.c, 3-main.c, 100-main.c, 101-main.c, 102-main.c**: Test files used to verify the correctness of the sorting algorithms.

### Temporary Swap Files

The following files are swap files generated during editing in a text editor. They can be ignored:

- `.1-insertion_sort_list.c.swp`
- `.1-main.c.swp`
- `.101-cocktail_sort_list.c.swp`

## How to Use

To run and test the sorting algorithms, compile the relevant `*.c` files using a C compiler, such as `gcc`. Below is an example of how to compile and run the Bubble Sort algorithm:

``` bash
gcc 0-bubble_sort.c 0-main.c -o bubble_sort
./bubble_sort
```

You can do the same for other algorithms by replacing the relevant source files in the compilation command.

## Performance Analysis
The performance of each algorithm has been analyzed in terms of time complexity and space complexity. We have also considered their behavior in best, average, and worst-case scenarios.
